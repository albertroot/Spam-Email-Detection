# SPEM EMAIL DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

### PROJECT ABSTRACT
<p align="justify">Spam emails pose significant challenges in digital communication, ranging from minor 
inconveniences to serious cybersecurity threats such as phishing and malware attacks. This 
research focuses on developing a robust spam email detection system using machine learning 
algorithms. The study aims to identify the most effective machine learning model by evaluating 
various algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble 
methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. The research investigates how dataset 
preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection impact detection accuracy, adaptability, 
and efficiency. 
A quantitative, experimental approach is adopted, with data sourced from publicly available email 
datasets such as Kaggle, SpamAssassin, and Enron. Stratified random sampling ensures a balanced 
representation of spam and non-spam emails. The models are trained and tested using performance 
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure their effectiveness. 
Additionally, system development and validation processes are explored to ensure the best
performing model's real-world applicability and generalizability. 
The findings are expected to demonstrate that combining advanced feature engineering techniques 
(e.g., TF-IDF, n-grams) with appropriate machine learning algorithms significantly improves 
spam detection performance. The results will inform the design of an adaptive spam detection 
system that can be integrated into modern email platforms, offering enhanced cybersecurity and 
efficient email filtering. This research contributes to both theoretical advancements and practical 
implementations in machine learning-based email security.</p>
